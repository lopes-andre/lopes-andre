### :computer: **ROV Submarine Supervisor** :joystick:

ROVs (*[underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles](https://youtu.be/CoOwT0X5dpo)*) are basically submarine robots operated from a cockpit on an special vessel or oil rig, all programmed in C++, [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy) and [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/). I am not a developer of the ROV's software but an Operations and Maintenance Supervisor, mainly performing inspections and interventions of subsea oilfield equipment.

I have mobilized, interfaced and commissioned multiple ROV systems, equipment from different manufacturers, using specific interfaces and communication protocols in order to centralize and interpret different returns on a main controller surface software. 

Installation, operation and maintenance of subsea sensors and devices, such as: UHD cameras, Digiquartz® depth sensor, acoustic positioning systems, sonars, microcontrollers and microprocessors, fiber optics modems, and multiplexers.
